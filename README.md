## Install

Click the [Use this template](https://github.com/Justintime50/python-template/generate) button at the top of this project's GitHub page to get started.

## Usage

### Easy text replacements

1. Replace all instances of `project_name` with the name of your project
    * These are the Python snake_case references (eg: `project_name`)
1. Replace all instances of `PROJECT_NAME_URL` with the name of your project
    * These are the references to your project that will appear in URLs and are typically hyphenated (eg: `project-name`)
1. Replace all instances of `USERNAME` with the name of the author or owner of the project
    * These are references typically found in the URL of your project as it appears on GitHub

### File configuration

1. Configure the `setup.py` file
1. Configure the `Makefile` targets
1. Update the name in the `LICENSE` or swap it out entirely
1. Configure the `.github/workflows/build.yml` file
1. Update the `CHANGELOG.md` with your own info
1. Rename other files/folders as needed and configure their content
1. Delete this `README` and rename `README_project.md` to `README.md`

### GitHub configuration

1. Add a `PYPI_API_TOKEN` GitHub secret to your project so that automated releasing can occur from GitHub Actions to PyPI and uncomment the final step on the `release` job in `.github/workflows/release.yml`
